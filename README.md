Ripping through a portal from the basements of Kalamazoo, Michigan, the release of The Spits VI has arrived. This full length, self recorded album from Thriftstore Records ranges from the weird to the wild. Buzz saw guitars and catchy hooks are mixed with low budget horror effects to create a unique view of a dystopian world. With songs of terror, despair, hope and heartbreak, this one has something for the whole nuclear family!
